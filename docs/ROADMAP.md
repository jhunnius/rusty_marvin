# Poker AI Testbed & Live Server Roadmap

## Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation âœ…

**Basic poker engine**
- Fast LUT hand evaluator (5, 6, and 7 cards) âœ…
- Game state management âœ…
- Game Info and Player Info traits âœ…
- Event reporting and action scheme âœ…
- Basic game rules (NL/FL/PL) âœ…

**Configuration system**
- TOML configuration structures âœ…
- Bot parameter configuration âœ…
- Game type configurations (Cash/SNG/MTT, buyins, blinds, hands per level, etc.) âœ…
- Simulation parameters (hands/tournaments count, buyin thresholds for bots, etc.) âœ…

**ðŸš€ Memory Optimization Achievement âœ…**
- **Perfect Hash Jump Table**: Revolutionary 79% memory reduction (625MB â†’ ~130MB)
- **Suit Canonicalization**: Advanced isomorphic hand reduction algorithm
- **Bottom-up Trie Construction**: Cache-optimized memory layout
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: Full API compatibility maintained
- **Performance Enhancement**: Faster evaluation for 6 and 7-card hands

### Phase 2: Simulation Testbed
**Goal:** Mass simulation capability

**Testbed core**
- Tournament/cash game runners
- Parallel simulation engine
- Result collection and analysis
- Bot interface with early folding capability
- Bot performance metrics & visualization
- Simulation and game factories
- Configuration-driven experiment runner

### Phase 3: Bot Framework
**Goal:** All bot types with playability enhancement

**Bot core implementations**
- Generic helper functions for strategies
- Modular Strategy per stage and game situation
- Rule-based bot with configurable thresholds â€“ port from Java
- Nash equilibrium calculator for SNG endgame â€“ port from Java
- Statistical tracking bot â€“ port from Java
- Logging of decision-making process

**Advanced bots**
- GPU acceleration for mass rollouts
- Hand-reading opponent modeling (possibly with GPU integration)
- Flop playability precomputation & score integration
- Basic reinforcement learning skeleton
- Hybrid bot combining multiple approaches
- Factory for bot and sub-strategy composition
- Genetic algorithm for bot evolution (via configuration files)

---

### Phase 4: "Unit Test" Framework
**Goal:** Bot behavior can be tested against predefined hands

**Hand Replayer**
- Poker Tracker style hands
- Action comparison to expected outcome
- Selection of hands from different sources (books)
- Action likelihoods (multiple replays)

---

### Phase 5: Live Server Infrastructure
**Goal:** Real-time bot deployment

**Server core**
- Network protocol design (TBD: WebSocket, JSON, MQ, etc.)
- Actions (incl. early fold and table selection), events (incl. table switches and available tables)
- Client registration and management
- Game state synchronization
- Action dispatch system
- Event logging for analysis of problems

**Client adapter system**
- Client factory for different poker environments
- Screen / protocol scraping adapters
- Table selection logic
- Configuration-driven game selection

---

### Phase 6: Integration & Polish
**Goal:** Production-ready system

**Advanced features**
- Real-time strategy adaptation
- Multi-table coordination
- Bankroll management
- Risk adjustment based on results

**Optimization and deployment**
- Performance profiling and optimization
